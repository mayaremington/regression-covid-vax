## The great divide: factors associated with low COVID vaccination rates in the US 

- Modeled county-level COVID-19 vaccination rates using linear regression (OLS, interaction & polynomial terms, regularization with Lasso & Ridge)  
- Used regression coefficients to determine which political and socioeconomic factors best explain the variations in COVID-19 vaccination rates  
- Obtained data by web scraping the CDC website with Selenium and BeautifulSoup
